# DragonBallZRadar
The following proposal presents a system, based off the popular television series Dragon Ball Z, 
used to track or locate nearest friends locations relative to one's own position. In the show, each 
of the Dragon Balls emits a faint electromagnetic pulse, which Dragon Radars can detect and point 
arrows in their general direction so that the characters may locate them. Pressing the button 
on the top of the radar can cause the view to zoom out and show a more detailed map of the area. 
Much like the radar in the television series, this is the real life “Dragonball Z Radar” an 
application where the dragon balls are the user’s friends. The application sends and receives 
constant updates while providing a means of effective communication between friends. A common 
scenario may be where the user is planning to meet their friends at a large convention, 
event or gathering. It’s quite difficult to meet up when everyone in the party does not 
know everyone else’s exact locations. Sometimes the user will attempt to communicate by 
calling, texting and pointing out landmarks. Other times this process is much more difficult 
and time consuming than it may appear. As a result, the user has no idea how long it may take 
to find their friends. This project presents a practical solution to this dilemma by using 
dynamic coordinates, as the Dragonball Z Radar will tell the user exactly how close they are 
to their friends relative to their current position as long as everyone has an iPhone. 
This will give the user a better idea about on everyone’s timing and position. All the user 
needs to do is simply add their group of friends (up to 7 individuals) and the radar will 
gather and share locations to all parties. When everyone converges the dots on the radar will 
get closer together signifying the party is almost together. Additionally, a group chat 
function will be implemented so the party can conveniently communicate on the go.
